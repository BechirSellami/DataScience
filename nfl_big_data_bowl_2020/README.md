# Summary:

This notebook is an attempt to reproduce the winning solution of the "NFL Big data bowl 2020" competition hosted by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020). In fact, the winning team discussed their approach and main ideas to solve this challenge, however, they didn't share the code implementation for their solution. 
Therefore, I'll attempt to reproduce the data cleaning, feature engineering and model building steps based on the information available.
